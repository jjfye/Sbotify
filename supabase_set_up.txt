Created a database using Supabase which provided me with three URLs that
I need to connect my front-end to the back-end. This includes the following:
*********************************
* NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL      *
* NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY *
* SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY     *
*********************************

I created several tables using the SQL editor in Supabase by utilizing the
Quick Start option for Stripe Subscriptions. This has provided me with several
tables in which I have added more to.

- customers
- prices
- products
- subscriptions
- users
- liked_songs
- songs

Row Level Security is a feature that enables which users are permitted to perform actions
such as SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements on specific rows within tables. This is to enforce security
and access control within the application.

I have added RLS Policies to "liked_songs" and "songs" to allow certain permissions
for specific users. An example of this is allowing ONLY authenticated users to add songs.

Supabase gives access to create storages in which I have used to allow users to add/remove/update songs/images
